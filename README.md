# Robotics

Task:
 - Create an Android application which provides mobile robot navigation to the desired predefined goal pose (x,y,theta)
 from pose (0,0,0) while avoiding obstacles along the way.

TODO:

implement bug 2 algorithm:

 - turnUntil is not accurate enough, the theta value is not correct  and hence leads to wrong x/y calculations
 - the rest is working alright

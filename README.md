# Robotics

Task:
 - Create an Android application which provides mobile robot navigation to the desired predefined goal pose (x,y,theta)
 from pose (0,0,0) while avoiding obstacles along the way.

TODO:

 - implement bug 2 algorithm:
think of what the sensors values should look like when the robot is aligned parallel (implement the alignedParallel SensorCondition).
remember to give it some threshold so that the robot does not re-orientate itself by something like 0.001Â° after every step.
